		<h3>Personal Statement:</h3>
		
			
			<p class="blockedText">
				Entering college at Boston University, I had zero experience programming and did not truly understand the vast range of potential applications software had. 
				Three semesters later and I'm fascinated with so many aspects of the field.
				As a kid, I always liked tinkering with things and building structures, from wooden train sets to popsicle stick bridges.
				Growing up, I was the resident IT expert in my house and had a knack for fixing problems (my respects to Google). 
				As I quickly learned, Computer and Software Engineering combined the power of computers with the need for problem solving
				to create an interesting field. Over the last year and a half, I have quickly learned about many related technologies and languages and have
				supplemented my education with independent learning about languages like Java and fields such as Web and iOS development. I don't view
				this work as "work" and simply enjoy the opportunities to expand my abilities to solve problems and create new things
