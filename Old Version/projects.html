		<h3>Time Tracking Android App - Introduction to Software Engineering</h3>
		
		<h4>Description</h4>
		
		<p>
			
			For my Software Engineering Course, I collaborated with several other students to create an android app to track time spent on coursework. 
			This app allows the user to input his/her classes for the semester as well as specific tasks for each class. Users can then track how much time is spent 
			on each task and view specific statistics for each class and task. 
			
		</p>
		
		<h4>My Role in the Project</h4>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>Assisted with GUI design and planning for the functionality of the app</li>
			
			<li>Implemented local storage features using SQLite</li>
			
			<li>Coordinated version control system on GitHub</li> 
		
		</ul>
		 
		<h4>Tools/Languages Used</h4>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>SQLite</li>
			
			<li>Java</li>
			
			<li>Android Studio</li>
			
			<li>GitHub</li>
			
		</ul>

		<h3>Truss Design Project</h3>
		
		<h4>Description</h4>
		
		<p>
			For my Static Mechanics class, I collaborated with several classmates to design, analyze, and optimize a 2D straw truss. For this project, 
			straws were first tested to determine a relationship between length and buckling weight. Considering this relationship, my group designed several different
			2D trusses with the goal of creating the strongest truss at the smallest cost. I then developed a matlab script to determine the max load sustained, the failing member, 
			the cost, and the force in each member for each truss design. Using this program, several more designs were made to optimize the load to cost ratio and the final design was eventually constructed
			and tested.
		</p>
		
		<h4>My Role in the Project</h4>
		
		<p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>Developed a Matlab script to determine the forces in each member and the other statistics mentioned above</li>
			
			<li>Contributed to the optimization of the design and the construction of the truss</li>
			
			<li>Organized meetings and planned schedules and deadlines for the semester long project</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		</p>
		
		<h4>Tools/Languages Used</h4>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>Matlab</li>
			
			<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Further Information</h4>
		
		<p>
		
		Check out the matlab script on my 
		<a href="https://github.com/mwcote/2D-Truss-Analysis">GitHub Repository</a>
		to view the source code or run the test on the final design.
